Emotion Detection Using Speech

Project Overview

The Emotion Detection Using Speech project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying the emotional state of a person based on their speech. The model can classify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. Additionally, the project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and visualization of the results.


Features

- Emotion Detection : Identifies the emotional state of a person based on their speech.

- Real-time Analysis : Capable of analyzing speech in real-time.

- Audio File Input : Supports input from pre-recorded audio files.

- GUI : Provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction and visualization of results.


Technologies Used

- TensorFlow Keras : For building and training the emotion detection model.

- Librosa : For audio processing and feature extraction.

- Tkinter : For creating the graphical user interface.

- Scikit-learn : For additional machine learning utilities and preprocessing.
